"""Run every check in this directory.

    python tests/run_all.py

Plain functions named check_* rather than a framework. Nothing here needs Airflow or dbt
installed, so this runs on a clean machine with only requirements.txt. The parts that do
need Airflow are exercised by scripts/dag_smoke.sh instead, and that gap is named in the
README.
